Students Study Better is a student management app geared towards Gwinnett County High School students. The SSB app consists of many intuitive features such as the school activities calendar, breakfast and lunch menus, assignment viewer, a grade calculator, and many more. This app was started by three Grayson High School students as a project, but we would like to expand this app in the future. Please leave us feedback regarding how we can improve. Thank you!
